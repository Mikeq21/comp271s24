The source code for the original toString Method is:
 
205:   public String toString()
206:   {
207:     return getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
208:   }

The problem with tis approach is with the Integer.toHexString(hashCode()) 
portion of the return statement. The reason why it is like this is to
recieve the memory adress of the location of the object in Hexadecimal format.

To improve this, I would override the source code's "toString()" with my own:

205:   public String toString()
206:   {
207:     return "TrainLine Station: " + name + "\n Next Station: " + next;
208:   }

The reason why I believe this is better, is because our goal is to print
the object itself, not the name of the class behind the object.

In this new toString() design, we return the name of the station, as well
as the next station in the line. This would benefit us the most in my
opinion, so that we can fully understand where we are at in line.
