Comp 271 Self-Assessment 

Throughout this course, I have actively engaged in all 
class activities and assignments, striving to understand 
and apply the material effectively.  

Imagining myself at a job interview based on this course's 
content, I feel that an A- is appropriate to attribute to 
my performance. While there might be another student who 
performed slightly better in certain areas, I have the 
confidence towards the end of this semester to say I believe 
my work is among the top in the class.  

I attended almost all classes, missing only one session due to
an emergency, and ensuring I was consistently on time.My camera
was on for every meeting I attended, and I actively participated
in the teams meeting hour each day. I sought help via email when
needed and often asked questions when I was confused during class.  

I always aimed to submit my best work, holding myself to a high
standard when it came to quality. At the beginning of the
semester, I gave myself multiple yellows, and a few reds.
However, as the semester went on, I eventually earned myself
multiple greens as I improved. I consistently reviewed solutions
and grading notes, identified and learned from my mistakes, and used 
the Programmers Pact checklist to avoid repeating errors. I also 
completed assignment reviews. While scheduling meetings with the 
instructor to discuss early issues were unsuccessful due to scheduling
 problems, most of my code still felt improved from when I began.  

Despite facing challenges such as adapting to Codespaces, I spent
hours outside of class trying to understand it better, and attribute
part of my bad early performance to that. Based on this assessment,
I propose a course grade of A-.
